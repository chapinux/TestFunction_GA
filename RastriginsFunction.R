# 
# Rastriginâ€™s function is based on the function of De Jong with the addition of cosine
# modulation in order to produce frequent local minima. Thus, the test function is
# highly multimodal. However, the location of the minima are regularly distributed.

# Function has the following definition


#f(x) = 10 * n  + sum for i = 1 to n  x[i]^2  - 10 * cos (2*Pi * x[i])
 #minimum is obtained for x[i] = 0 and is 0 s

z <- 10*2 +   (points$Var1^2  - 10* cos ( 2* pi * points$Var1) )  + (points$Var2^2  - 10* cos ( 2* pi * points$Var2))
