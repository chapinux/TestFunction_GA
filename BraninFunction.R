# The Branin function is a global optimization test function having only two va-
#   riables. The function has three equal-sized global optima, and has the following
# definition
# 
# 
# t is recommended to set the following values of parameters: 
# a = 1, b =  5.1 / (4 * pi ^2)
# c= 5 * pi 
# d = 6
# e = 10, 
#f = 1 / 8 * pi . Three global optima equal f (x 1 , x 2 ) = 0.397887
# are located as follows: (x 1 , x 2 ) = (âˆ’pi, 12.275), (pi, 2.275), (9.42478, 2.475).
