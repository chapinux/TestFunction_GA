# Rosenbrockâ€™s valley is a classic optimization problem, also known as banana
# function or the second function of De Jong. The global optimum lays inside a
# long, narrow, parabolic shaped flat valley. To find the valley is trivial, however
# convergence to the global optimum is difficult and hence this problem has been
# frequently used to test the performance of optimization algorithms. Function has
# the following definition


#function expression : 
 # sum for i from 1 to n-1  100 * ( x[i+1] - x[i]^2 )^2 + (1-x[i])^2 

# minimum valoues is 0 obtaines for x1 = -+ 1 ???
